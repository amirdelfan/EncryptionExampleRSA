This example demonstrates a hybrid encryption approach where RSA is used to securely exchange a symmetric key (AES), and AES is used to encrypt the actual data. By following this approach, you can leverage the strengths of both symmetric and asymmetric encryption for secure data transmission

Generate Public and Private Keys: The receiving party generates a public and private key pair.
Share the Public Key: The receiving party shares their public key with you.
Encrypt Data with Public Key: You encrypt the data using the received public key.
Send Encrypted Data: You send the encrypted data to the receiving party.
Decrypt Data with Private Key: The receiving party decrypts the data using their private key.


Symmetric Encryption
Algorithm: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a popular symmetric encryption algorithm.

Key: Uses a single shared secret key for both encryption and decryption.

Performance: Generally faster and more efficient for encrypting large amounts of data.

Security: The main challenge is securely sharing and managing the secret key. If the key is compromised, the security of the encrypted data is at risk.

Asymmetric Encryption
Algorithm: RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a commonly used asymmetric encryption algorithm.

Keys: Uses a pair of keysâ€”a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

Performance: Slower and more computationally intensive, making it less suitable for encrypting large volumes of data directly.

Security: Simplifies secure key exchange, as the public key can be shared openly while the private key remains confidential. However, key management is more complex, and key lengths need to be larger to achieve comparable security to symmetric keys.

Security Comparison
Key Distribution: Asymmetric encryption is more secure for key distribution since the public key can be shared openly without compromising security.

Speed: Symmetric encryption is generally faster and more efficient for encrypting large datasets.

Use Cases: Asymmetric encryption is often used for securing the exchange of symmetric keys, which are then used for encrypting the actual data.

Hybrid Approach
In practice, many systems use a combination of both:

Key Exchange: Asymmetric encryption (RSA) is used to securely exchange a symmetric key.

Data Encryption: Symmetric encryption (AES) is used to encrypt the actual data using the exchanged symmetric key.
